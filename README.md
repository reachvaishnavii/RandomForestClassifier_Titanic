# Titanic Survival Classification using Random Forest

This is a small machine learning project where a Random Forest Classifier is used to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their personal and travel details.

## Project Overview
The dataset comes from the classic **Titanic dataset** used for classification problems.  
The target variable is **'Survived'**, which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  
- Training a Random Forest Classifier  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Requirements
Install dependencies using:
   pip install -requirements.txt

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the notebook or Python script  
3. Run all cells to see results and visualizations

## Output
The model reports the classification accuracy and displays a confusion matrix for model performance.
